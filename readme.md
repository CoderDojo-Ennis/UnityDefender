* Spatial sound
* Post-Processing effects for fog, bloom, depth of field
* Radar screen overlay
* Split screen gameplay for cooperative or dogfight modes

## Instructions
Instructions will be added to the wiki for this project each week. If you happen to miss a week, please review what was covered and give it a try at home to be prepared for the next lesson.
